        <h2>Interactive Transcriptions</h2>
        <p>
            First, here is a transcription of the sentence
            "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".
            Try to think of the phonemic transcription of each word,
            and then hover over it to see if you got it right!
            You can also click on a phoneme to see its features.
        </p>

        <h2>Feature Bundles</h2>
        <p>
            Here are some feature bundles representing some phonemes
            and natural classes in English.
            Can you figure out what they are?
            For a hint, you can click on any feature in the bundle
            to see the list of English phonemes with that feature.
            To see the answer, click on the brackets of the bundle.

        <h2>Phonological Rules</h2>
        <p>
            Here are some rules.
            Again, try to figure out what they do
            and click on the features if you need a hint!
